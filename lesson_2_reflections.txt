What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you git init, you create an empty repository in a directory. There are no commits saved initially, but there are files that are untracked. 

You need to initialize a repository because otherwise git doesnt have anything to save commits to. The files are simply files, rather than saved and tracked together. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary space where you can make changes prior to commiting to a repo. 

The working directory is active, the repo saves things in different states, but the staging area is a sort of middle ground to move files around. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can compare changes in the working directory to the staging area before adding documents, to be sure what is happening.

Then you can compare what is in the staging area to the current commit to be sure that you commit only what you expect.
