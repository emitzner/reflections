What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you git init, you create an empty repository in a directory. There are no commits saved initially, but there are files that are untracked. 

You need to initialize a repository because otherwise git doesnt have anything to save commits to. The files are simply files, rather than saved and tracked together. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary space where you can make changes prior to commiting to a repo. 

The working directory is active, the repo saves things in different states, but the staging area is a sort of middle ground to move files around.
