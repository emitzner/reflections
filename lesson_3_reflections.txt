When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working collaboratively, it is helpful to save projects on GitHub, where multiple people can easily access
and change files. Also, even if working by yourself, GitHub adds a layer of protection to saving, and lets you 
reach your files on multiple computers (say if you work at home and work).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Others might make changes to a remote, or you may have changes that you aren't ready to share yet
