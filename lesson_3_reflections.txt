When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working collaboratively, it is helpful to save projects on GitHub, where multiple people can easily access
and change files. Also, even if working by yourself, GitHub adds a layer of protection to saving, and lets you 
reach your files on multiple computers (say if you work at home and work).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Others might make changes to a remote, or you may have changes that you aren't ready to share yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 

Forks - when you want to edit/start from someone else's existing github repo

Clones - when you want to edit a repo on github on a local machine

Branches - when you want to start new edits to a feature or bug without disrupting your own master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A copy of the remote state makes it easier to merge because you have something
to compare local changes and remote changes with to make the merge decisions
